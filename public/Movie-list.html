<h1>The Best Shows According to Croix</h1>
<h2>My top 3 shows of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Invincible</h3>
<p>This is my favourite superhero show! It super realistic in my opinion.</p>
<h3>Final Space</h3>
<p>This is just such a great show and it kept me hooked throughout it's entirety.</p>
<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>I cant express how good this anime was it was dark, creepy, and kept you guessing at all points of the show.</p>
<p>
    Here is a list using break elements: <br />
    1. Cats <br />
    2. Dogs <br>
    3. Fish <br>
    4. Bunnies <br>
    Thats pretty much it for my list, pretty much random. I didnt have a goal of what I wanted it to say when starting the list.

<p>There you go thats another use of the horizontal rule tag. <br>
    Pretty cool right!
